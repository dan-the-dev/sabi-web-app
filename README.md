## What is SABI

SABI is a voice-first journaling and reflection web app designed for knowledge workers, founders, and creators who think better out loud.

Instead of writing, users speak their day. SABI listens, transcribes, and gently organizes spoken thoughts into:

- a daily journal entry  
- insights and learnings  
- a living to-do list that carries over unfinished items  

SABI is not a productivity optimizer, a habit tracker, or a coaching app. It is a quiet system for daily sense-making and continuity.

**Payoff:** *“Let your day speak.”*

## Core Philosophy

- **Reflection** > optimization  
- **Continuity** > streaks  
- **Attention** > productivity pressure  
- **Voice** > writing friction  

SABI is intentionally calm, minimal, non-gamified, and non-judgmental. No streaks, no scores, no growth language.

## Core User Experience (Daily Loop)

1. **Morning — Kickoff**  
   User records a voice message describing intentions for the day. SABI transcribes the audio, extracts initial to-do items, and creates the daily workspace.

2. **During the day — To-do list**  
   A living to-do list generated by AI. Users can edit items manually and mark them done. Unfinished items automatically carry over to the next day.

3. **Evening — End of Day**  
   User records a second voice message. SABI summarizes the day, extracts insights and learnings, suggests soft observations, and extracts new to-do items (auto-added or confirmed).

4. **Loop reset**  
   Each new day starts clean and keeps only what still matters. The process repeats daily.

## Non-Goals

SABI is not a habit tracker, coaching app, mental health app, productivity optimizer, or social platform. No streaks, gamification, badges, leaderboards, or growth language.

---

## Brand & Tone

Editorial, minimal, calm, observational — human, not hype-driven.

**Visual style:** muted sage / paper palette, large whitespace, slow subtle animations.
